# PoseNet-and-p5js
An experiment with PoseNet and p5.js. Try to bounce the ball from one hand to another. Camera required.

Stand at least one meter from the camera for best results.

*I use it as a comparison to capabilities of OpenCV in Processing vs Deep Learning model. Probably I will do more examples with ml5.js library, ml4a etc.*
